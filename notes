If you prefer a hands-on approach, the materials for Noah's class are good, and you can see RSA models in the ESSLI course notes (as well as in the pragmatics chapter on Probmods - v2): http://cocolab.stanford.edu/psych204-fall2016.html (final week - section on natural language pragmatics and semantics, see esp. the ESSLI course notes).
