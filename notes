meeting notes:

12/7

Pragmatics, RSA - rational speech acts model
remove need to build semantics by hand, learn semantics -> plug to RSA -> predict human usage
watch task where two people chat via window, describe actions to someone (pick a box)
katherine, robert presented
relies on deep amortized inference


smaller projects:
consult: daniel, paul
benchmarking methods
swapping otu tensor backend for somethign more efficient - (best ways tp do that?)
bind directly to torch backend, node ffi 
efficiency of tensorflow? compared to torch 

time series:
hmm - discrete
 filter- continuous
 using autoencoders - deep common filter: filter.  transition functio is deepnet LSTM-like. recognition model that learns inference. - can write in webppl. will it work?

try running inference on time series models - how well does it work and scale?
consult: paul, ndg
evolution of a ecosystem, financial modeling, baseball
